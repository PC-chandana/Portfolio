								<h3>1. GAIT Global, Hyderabad (May'2023 - Present)</h3>
								<p style="color:lightcoral; font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px;"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/BeforeMG.png" alt="" height="530hv" /></span><span class="image fit"><img src="images/AfterMG.png" alt="" height="530hv" /></span> Project - OSCMI-based classification scheme for rapid and accurate mangrove mapping.</p>
								<p>There are two kinds of mangrove extraction methods: one is classification, and the other is index-based threshold segmentation or decision tree. Traditional classification method relies on a large number of samples and complex classifiers, which is not suitable for the large-scale extraction of mangrove because of low computational efficiency and poor generalization ability. Using vegetation index can extract target object on the large-scale rapidly, and vegetation index can represent vegetation properties better than using original and individual bands.
									<ul> 
									The existing mangrove indices have the following problems :- 
									<li>All mangrove indices are constructed based on optical remote sensing images, but the availability of optical images is affected by clouds and fog.</li>
									<li>Some mangrove indices need multi-temporal images of high tide and low tide to solve the problem of tide flooding, this has a higher demand for data and requires more effort in data screening.</li>
								    <li>Many mangrove indices have been tested in only one or a few areas (usually with tall and dense mangroves), but different types of mangroves (tall and dense forest or low and sparse forest, rich or single tree species) will have great differences in images, so the ability of the indices for mangrove extraction in different regions needs to be further verified.</li>
								</p>
									</ul>
									<p>To solve the above problems, an Optical and SAR images Combined Mangrove Index (OSCMI) has been introduced. And we will design an OSCMI-based classification scheme, which can reduce the impact of tidal inundation on mangrove extraction to a certain extent.</p>
									
									<p>Methodology:
									Firstly, the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images were pre-processed. Then, OSCMI were generated through band math, and the initial range of mangrove was extracted using threshold method.
									The OSCMI-based classification scheme mainly includes two steps. We firstly distinguished vegetation and non-vegetation by NDVI, and Table then we extracted mangrove from vegetation by OSCMI.
									</p>
									<p>

									Threshold:
									This paper (Optical and SAR images Combined Mangrove Index based on multi-feature fusion) constructed an Optical and SAR images Combined Mangrove Index (OSCMI) based on the idea of multi-feature fusion and designed an OSCMI-based classification scheme for rapid and accurate mangrove mapping. The OSCMI threshold is relatively stable, and the recommended threshold range is 0.04â€“0.07. And users can make some adjustments in different regions.

								<h3>1. Department of Science and Technology (WIGH), Dehradun (Jan' - May, 2023)</h3>
								<p style="color:lightcoral; font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px;"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Glacial.gif" alt="" height="530hv" /></span> Project - Glacial change detection mapping and analysis in Himachal region using combination of datasets (ASTER, DEM and Drone Imagery).</p>
								<p>In a focused endeavor centered on glacial change detection and mapping within the Himachal Region, I delved into the intricate landscape using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Leveraging Python as the programming language of choice, I meticulously implemented these algorithms to analyze the evolving glacial dynamics. The project involved a meticulous comparison of various ML algorithms against ground truth data to ascertain their accuracy, thereby informing decisions regarding their optimal utilization in detecting and mapping glacial changes. </p>
								<p>Additionally, I undertook the modeling of the region's Digital Elevation Model (DEM) through a combination of drone imagery and data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). This comprehensive approach not only provided a detailed representation of the terrain but also facilitated a deeper understanding of the spatial patterns of glacial activity. Furthermore, I ventured into the realm of environmental modeling by conducting carbon dioxide concentration mapping of the region. </p>

								<h3>2. Regional Remote Sensing Center (NRSC), Bengaluru (May - july, 2022)</h3>
								<p style="color:lightcoral; font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px;"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic_vs_sic.png" alt="" height="530hv" /></span> Project - Analysis of major coastline changes along southern Karnataka coast, India between 1965, 2006 and 2016 using Google Earth Engine.</p>
								<p> Utilizing advanced geospatial analysis techniques facilitated by Google Earth Engine, the study aims to assess and quantify alterations in coastline morphology spanning five decades. By leveraging the capabilities of Google Earth Engine, I have meticulously analyzed land-water interfaces, identified erosion and accretion patterns, and provided insights into the driving forces behind these changes.</p>
								<p>Through the implementation of change detection algorithms, I have effectively identified alterations in coastline positions across the selected time periods. Furthermore, I have quantified rates of erosion and accretion to gain a comprehensive understanding of the magnitude of coastal changes. In addition, I have employed deep learning algorithms to automatically delineate coastlines, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the analysis process. This integration of deep 
								learning techniques has contributed to a more robust and comprehensive evaluation of coastline dynamics in the study area. </p>
