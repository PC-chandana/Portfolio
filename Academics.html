							<p>"Cultivating the mind through education is akin to kindling a flame within oneself. With each spark of knowledge, we illuminate our path, 
                                transcending limitations and embracing possibilities. Education, the beacon of enlightenment, empowers us to navigate the complexities of 
                                life, to shape our destinies, and to leave an indelible mark upon the world. It is the key that unlocks the gates of opportunity, the bridge 
                                that spans divides, and the catalyst for personal and societal transformation. In its pursuit, we not only gain understanding but also find 
                                the strength to challenge conventions, the courage to confront adversity, and the wisdom to inspire change. Indeed, the power of education 
                                knows no bounds; it is the greatest force for liberation, the most potent tool for empowerment, and the steadfast companion on the journey 
                                towards self-realization and collective progress."</p>

								<h3>1. Master of Science in Geo - informatics (May, 2021 - May, 2023)</h3>
								<p style="color:lightcoral; font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px;"><span><img/></span> Thesis - “Seasonal Dynamics of Marine Vegetation and Carbon Sequestration Potential using measure of Particulate Organic Carbon in Palk Strait, Indian Ocean.”</p>
								<P style="color:rgb(148, 128, 240);"><span class="image center"><img src="images/MSc-2.png" alt="" height="400hv"/></span><br>Seasonal variation of Chlorophyll-A concentration (2004)</P>
								<p>The research aims to investigate how marine vegetation in the Palk Strait changes with the seasons and how this variation relates to the sequestration of carbon, with a specific focus on measuring Particulate Organic Carbon.</p>
								<p>The Palk Strait is situated between the southeastern coast of India and the northern tip of Sri Lanka. The region encompasses a variety of ecosystems, including coastal areas, estuaries, and marine environments, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
								<p>Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) refers to the organic carbon present in particulate form, meaning it is associated with particles suspended in the water. It can include organic matter from marine plants and other sources. Chlorophyll_a (Chl_a) is a pigment found in the chloroplasts of phytoplankton and other photosynthetic organisms. It plays a crucial role in photosynthesis by capturing light energy for the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into organic compounds. There is often a positive correlation between chl_a concentrations and POC. Higher chl_a levels indicate increased phytoplankton biomass, which, in turn, can contribute to higher POC levels as phytoplankton fix carbon through photosynthesis.</p>
								<p>Research study was conducted using various tools in machine learning, deep learning, data analysis, and statistical domain, all implemented in Python, Julia, and R Programming languages:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Performed Satellite data gap filling using Support Vector Machine Regressor using time series satellite data of the study area (Utilized both Spatial and Temporal information). </li>
									<li>Performed Time series forecasting using RNN-LSTM model, FbProphet model and ARIMA model.</li>
									<li>Preprocessing, cleaning, and automation of data analysis of data fetched from server using python scripts, auto conversion from netcdf to Geotiff. </li>
									<li>Application of statistical tests for significance testing (Welch’s T test).</li>
								</ul>

								<p>The relationship between POC and chl_a provides valuable insights into the productivity and carbon cycling in marine ecosystems. Studying these parameters helps scientists and ecologists understand the functioning of aquatic food webs and the response of marine environments to changing conditions. </p>

								<h3>1. Bachelor of Science in Chemistry (May, 2017 - May, 2020)</h3>
								<p style="color:lightcoral; font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px;"><span><img/></span> Thesis - “Mass Spectroscopy of textile pollutant Indanthrene red FFB” </p>
								<p>As a part of my undergraduate Thesis, I had chosen the above topic. In this project, using spectroscopy, we find the natural dyes and pollutants in textiles. When pollutants like Indanthrene Red FFB are introduced into blue carbon ecosystems, they can affect the growth, reproduction, and overall health of plants and animals, disrupting the delicate balance of the ecosystem also these pollutants interfere with the photosynthetic process in plants, leading to reduced carbon uptake and potentially weakening the ecosystem's carbon sequestration capacity.</p>
								<p>Mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique used to identify and characterize chemical compounds based on their mass-to-charge ratio. Mass spectrometry of a textile pollutant, such as Indanthrene red FFB, involves the application of this technique to analyze the chemical composition of the pollutant. </p>
								<span class="image center"><img src="images/BSc-1.png" alt="" height="430hv" width="900vw"/></span>
								<p>1.	Textile Pollutant - Indanthrene Red FFB:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Indanthrene Red FFB: This likely refers to a specific dye or chemical compound used in textiles, possibly in the dyeing process. Indanthrene dyes are a class of vat dyes known for their fastness properties and are commonly used in the textile industry.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>2.	Mass Spectrometry (MS):</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Principle: MS involves ionizing a sample to generate charged particles (ions) and then measuring their mass-to-charge ratio. This process provides information about the molecular weight and structure of the compounds present in the sample.</li>
									<li>Ionization Methods: Different ionization methods can be employed, such as electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), depending on the nature of the sample.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>3.	Analysis of Indanthrene Red FFB:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Sample Preparation: The textile pollutant, Indanthrene Red FFB, would be extracted and prepared for analysis. This may involve techniques like liquid chromatography (LC) to separate components before MS analysis.</li>
									<li>Ionization: The prepared sample is subjected to ionization, creating ions that are then introduced into the mass spectrometer.</li>
									<li>Mass Analysis: The mass spectrometer separates ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio, and a detector records the abundance of each ion.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>4.	Interpretation:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Spectra Interpretation: The resulting mass spectrum provides a unique fingerprint of the compounds present in the sample, allowing for identification and characterization.</li>
									<li>Database Comparison: The obtained mass spectra can be compared to databases of known compounds to identify the specific chemical constituents of Indanthrene Red FFB.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>5.	Applications:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Quality Control: Mass spectrometry is crucial for quality control in industries like textiles to ensure that products meet regulatory standards.</li>
									<li>Environmental Analysis: Studying pollutants in textiles is essential for understanding their environmental impact and developing strategies for mitigation.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Assessing the impact on blue carbon involves considering the fate of these chemicals in aquatic environments and their potential ecological consequences, including toxicity and bioaccumulation. Monitoring and mitigating the release of such pollutants are critical for the preservation of blue carbon ecosystems and overall environmental health.</p>
